##SaRTree v1.2
------------
An ideal bacterial phylogenetic tree accurately retraces evolutionary history and accurately incorporates mutational, recombination and other events on the appropriate branches. Current strain-level bacterial phylogenetic analysis based on large numbers of genomes lacks reliability and resolution, and is hard to be replicated, confirmed and reused, because of the highly divergent nature of microbial gemomes. We present SaRTree, a pipeline using six “living trees” modules, that addresses problems arising from the high numbers and variable quality of bacterial genome sequences. It provides for reuse of the tree and offers a major step towards global standardization of phylogenetic analysis by generating deposit files including all steps involved in phylogenetic inference. The tree itself is a “living tree” that can be extended by addition of more sequences, or the deposit can be used to vary the programs or parameters used, to assess the effect of such changes. This approach will allow phylogeny papers to meet the traditional responsibility of providing data and analysis that can be repeated and critically evaluated by others. SaRTree is designed for prokaryote strain-level analysis but could be adapted for other usage. 
------------------------------------------

##Version & License:
------------------------------------------
SaRTree is for locating evolutionary events onto phylogenetic trees or building high resolution trees based on mutation events, StrainLocater is for locating new strains onto existing trees.

Please note that this is the early stage release version v1.2, so not all of the functions work well now and many parts of the codes run slowly and redundantly.

There is no warranties coming with SaRTree, so that users must be responsible for the results generated by SaRTree.

------------------------------------------
SaRTree is written in perl, so normaly it is no need to install it. To use SaRTree, uncompress the release package and then install all dependencies before using. **After installed all dependencies, please revise the path of them and parameters in "Config" file to setup default settings for those third-party software.**

###Dependencies Install:

####Conda users:
Please run **'sh install-conda.sh'** to install all the dependencies automatically. Then an environment called **'env_sartree'** will be created and please use **'source activate env_sartree'** to start the environment before running SaRTree.

####Ubuntu users:
Please try **'sudo perl install-ubuntu.pl'** and follow the guide.

####Other users:
Please run the script **"install.pl"** to install perl modules automatically, which may require users to manually install RAxML, progressiveMauve(v2.3.1 is recommended) and Beast and then manually revise the path and parameters of them in the configure file **"Config"**.

####Manually install:
Ubuntu users:
Please try **'sudo cpan -i FindBin Getopt::Long Bio::SeqIO Bio::TreeIO Bio::AlignIO'** to install perl packages and try **'sudo apt-get install mauve-aligner raxml beast-mcmc'** to install third-party software.

Conda users:
Please add channels "conda-forge", "defaults" ,"r", "bioconda" and "esteinig" by 
	**'conda config --add channels conda-forge r bioconda esteinig'**
	
And then create a running environment with dependencies installing by 
	**'conda create -y --name env_sartree perl perl-yaml-libyaml perl-bioperl perl-findbin perl-getopt-long raxml mauve beast'**
	
Then run

------------------------------------------


##Usage:
------------------------------------------

###==============SaRTree core==============

1. make a working directory (e.g. mkdir test)


2. (optional) put reference sequence(fasta file, complete genome, 1 chromosome) and its annotation(gff file) into working directory (use "strainname".fna and "strainname".gff as the format of file names, e.g. AB0057.fna and AB0057.gff) (will support multi chromosomes in formal version)


3. choose a model which depends on the input files("standard" for mauve result, "raw" for raw sequence data, "formatted" for SaRTree format mapping or snp listi, for continuing existing run interupted by rooting the tree)

    for "standard" model, (the recommended running model)
make a directory named "mauve"(without the quotes) in the working directory (temporarily only mauve result rupport) put all pairwise aligment result by Mauve(btw ref and each strain) into the directory (use "strainname".mauve as the format of file name, e.g. ZJ06.mauve)

    for "raw" model, (run mauve in the script, will support multi-threads in formal version) make a directory named "seq"(without the quotes) in the working directory
put all raw samples' sequences (fasta format, use "strainname".fna as the format of file name, e.g. ZJ06.fna) into the directory

    for "formatted" model, (not recommended, just for test) put SaRTree format snp list file (a tab separated file named as "tag".list,the "tag" should be same as the one using for the -t option, with the format:

    location	ref	-s1-	-s2-	...

    1234	A	T	T	...

    2345	T	T	A	...

    ) and the name list file (tab separated txt file, with format:

    ref	AB0057

    -s1-	ZJ06

    -s2-	...

    ...

    ) into working directory

    for "root" model,
use the same commond as the first run and add -u to indicate the rooted tree.

    for "beast" model,
use the same commond as the first run and add -d to indicate the isolation dates and add -u to indicate the nex format output tree from TreeAnnotator.

4. run the main script:

    perl SaRTree.pl -i &lt;work dir> -t &lt;output tag> -f &lt;ref sequence(fna)> -g &lt;ref annotation(gff)> -m &lt;standard/raw/formatted/root/beast> [options]


###==============StrainLocater==============

1. make a working directory (e.g. mkdir test) and make a directory named "query" in the working directory


2. (optional) put reference sequence(fasta file, complete genome, 1 chromosome) into working directory (use "strainname".fna as the format of file name, e.g. AB0057.fna) (will support multi chromosomes in formal version)


3. choose a model which depends on the input files("standard" for mauve result, "raw" for raw sequence data, "formatted" for SaRTree format mapping or snp list)


    the details of models are similar to the "SaRTree core" section above, but NOTE that all the input files should be put into "work dir"query/seq ("raw" model), "work dir"/query/mauve ("standard" model)or "work dir"/query/ ("formatted" model)
Adding a "query" directory separately is to make it possible to run SaRTree core and StrainLocater in the same working directory conveniently


4. run the main script: (indicating newick format target tree file and SaRTree format, see the "formatted" model section, snp list file for the tree)

    perl SaRTree.pl [options] -l -i &lt;work dir> -t &lt;output tag> -f &lt;ref sequence(fna)> -u &lt;target tree(nwk)> -s &lt;snp list(SaRTree format)> -m &lt;standard/raw/formatted>

------------------------------------------

##Output Interpretation:
------------------------------------------

After finishing all the process of the main script, all the meaningful output files will be put in a directory named "result" which is built automatically in the working directory. The files in "tmp" directory are temporary files which are used to trace back to find bugs, recommend to delete the directory after checking all the result.

The information within the files are as below:
(will rename all the output files in formal version to make them more reasonable)

###==============SaRTree==============

    example/result/<tag>.name.nwk: when using RAxML to build the phylogenetic tree, this is a newick format tree file with the original branch length and bootstrap re sult based on the mutation events
    example/result/<tag>.event.name.nex: the tree with all evolutionary events located on branches in nexus format, "events" section of each branch shows the located events, using the format "__(number of mutations)__(number of recombinations)__(number of indels)__", which are easy to show by a third party software FigTree using its "node bar" or "branch bar" function.
    example/result/<tag>.date.nex: created when -b used, nexus format tree file with divergence dates as branches lengths when BEAST is using, for more detail of it, please see documents of BEAST, and to show the data, a third party software FigTree is recommended.
    example/result/branch.xls: a summary of all evolutionary events and other information of each branch
    example/result/branch.xls.pattern2branch.xls: correspondence between pattern type and branch index
    example/result/<tag>.snp.final.xls: a summary of all mutation events' information including branches located, annotation and brief profiles
    example/result/<tag>.rec.final.xls: a summary of all recombination events' information including branches located, annotation and brief profiles
    example/result/<tag>.indel.final.xls: created when "raw" or "standard" model used, a summary of all indel events' information including lengths of sequences of each sample at the indel regions, branches located, annotation and brief profiles
    example/result/<tag>.indel.seq.name.xls: created when "raw" or "standard" model used, a summary of all indel events' sequences of each sample at the indel region.

###==============StrainLocater==============

    example/query/result/<tag>.nodes.txt: description of each indexed node
    example/query/result/<tag>.ourOfTree.txt: the strains without good enough location on the tree are excluded out of the result
    example/query/result/<tag>.onTree.txt: a summary of the strains could be located on the target tree and their locations
    example/query/result/<tag>.tree.nex: a nexus tree file with information of new strains' locations, "located" section of each branch shows the located strains, which could be showed by third party software FigTree using "node bar" or "branch bar" function.
------------------------------------------

##Example:
------------------------------------------
A set of Acinetobacter baumannii genomes is included as an example in the "example" directory.

**The script "example.sh" includes all the basic commands to run this example, could just try "sh example.sh" to test.**

###==============input files details==============

	example/ACICU.fna	:reference genome sequence file
	example/ACICU.gff	:reference genome annotation file
	example/date.txt	:(for BEAST, USELESS in this version)2-column tab-separated text file with isolation dates information
	example/seq/<name>.fna	:all the other strains' complete genome sequence files for SaRTree core
	example/query/seq/<name>.fna	:all the query strains' draft genome sequence files for StrainLocater

###==============example commands==============

    cd /home/user/SaRTree-v1.2
    perl SaRTree.pl -i /home/user/SaRTree-v1.2/example/ -t test -f example/ACICU.fna -g example/ACICU.gff -m raw -o 307-0294
    perl SaRTree.pl -l -i /home/user/SaRTree-v1.2/example/ -t test -f example/ACICU.fna -u example/result/test.name.nwk -s example/result/test.snp.final.xls -m raw

After all processes finished, all output files for SaRTree core should be found in "example/result" directory and output files for StrainLocater in "example/query/result".

------------------------------------------

###==============example for manually rooting==============

    cd /home/user/SaRTree-v1.2
    perl SaRTree.pl -i /home/user/SaRTree-v1.2/example/ -t test -f example/ACICU.fna -g example/ACICU.gff -m raw -r man

(Then root the output tree "/home/user/SaRTree-v1.2/example/result/test.name.nwk" by hand and save the rooted tree as nwk format for example "/home/user/SaRTree-v1.2/example/test.rooted.nwk" )

    perl SaRTree.pl -i /home/user/SaRTree-v1.2/example/ -t test -f example/ACICU.fna -g example/ACICU.gff -m root -r man -u /home/user/SaRTree-v1.2/example/test.rooted.nwk

Then will go on the following steps. The "beast" model is similar.

------------------------------------------

###==============example config==============

    cd /home/user/SaRTree-v1.2
    perl SaRTree.pl -p example/test.config.txt

With only a config file indicating all usefull parameters, SaRTree could be repeated easily

------------------------------------------

##Other Notices:
------------------------------------------

1. For tree painting, SaRTree is not focusing on this part, only provide a small script named treeview.pl to show phylogenetic tree on commond line text interface. All the useful information within a tree is included in nexus format tree files. User could choose any tree-viewing software or user's own scripts which could open nexus format files to visualize the output data. It is recommended to use a third party software "FigTree" <http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/> to show the information.
2. Due to the complexity of the parameters of BEAST, it is recommended to run BEAST independently.
3. It is also recommended to run MAUVE independently by user.
4. All the scripts included in "script" directory could be ran independently for debugging.
5. No temporary file will be deleted automatically for debugging.
------------------------------------------

##Things Coming in Next Version:
------------------------------------------

1. supporting for more recombination-event-detecting software
2. supporting for mapping software and result input
3. supporting for multi chromosomes
4. supporting for parameters of RecDetect
5. supporting for complex algorithms for StrainLocater
6. optimizing all codes and performance
7. supporting for more tree-building software
8. supporting for step-wise running, so that user could run BEAST, RAxML and other third party softwares independently
9. trouble shooting and input/output checking
------------------------------------------
